									<h2 style="display:inline;">Associate Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman</h2>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <h3 style="display:inline;">(July 2023 - Present)</h3>
									<p></p>
									<p>I researched and implemented algorithms for mecanum wheeled movements in code and developed an MVP software to control the
										movement of 4 individual load-bearing mecanum wheeled vehicles at the same time through the use of an RF controller. I also developed
										code to handle frequency control for the vehicles and utilised libraries such as Py-PS4 to achieve this. These efforts allowed me to
										create presentations and demos to gain additional internal funding that totaled about $10,000. In addition, I Implemented
										functionality into company auto-metrics and SLOC Count repos while updating Jenkins scripts.

									across the world. I then managed to complete my qualification and became a Senior Analyst and started finding ways to take down 
									malware attacks as well.</p>
									<p>As a Senior Analyst I worked to both develop and maintain Python Scripts to automate many of the companyâ€™s tasks which helped reduce 
										our handled attack times to below the industry bar of 12 hours. I also became a shift manager and managed my own team as well as
